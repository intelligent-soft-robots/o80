# Installation

o80 is a c++ library with python wrappers. It uses catkin for compilation.
It has been tested only on ubuntu 18.04 and python3.
To use o80, you will need:
- a machine installed with ubuntu 18.04, possibly with a preempt patch kernel, if your robot requires it.
- installing a few dependencies (apt and pip installation only):
```bash
apt install -y ssh \
               python3-pip \
               git \
	       cmake \
	       libcereal-dev \
	       libboost-all-dev \
	       libgtest-dev \
	       libeigen3-dev \
	       libedit-dev \
	       libncurses5-dev \
	       freeglut3-dev \
	       libxmu-dev
	       
pip3 install catkin_tools treep fyplot pyside2 empy
```
- creating a catkin workspace with o80 + dependencies packages (we use the project manager [Treep](https://pypi.org/project/treep/) to make this trivial)
- creating a catkin project that will host your c++ code. Your c++ code will be the classes used for State, Observation, as well as the Driver interfacing
  o80 and your robot (see [next page](https://intelligent-soft-robots.github.io/code_documentation/o80/docs/html/doc/03.integration.html) for explanation of what State, Observation and Driver are). o80 has been designed to that this code may be minimalist.
- create the python binders (o80 provides some high level functions to makes this trivial)

o80 is mostly a templated header library. It can thus only be installed in relation with a package which provides concrete class to be used as template. Thus the detailed installation procedure (that end up with demos you will be able to run) is available along with a package providing such concrete classe:  [o80 example](https://github.com/intelligent-soft-robots/o80_example)
