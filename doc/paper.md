# Summary

## Overview

o80 (pronounced "oh-eighty") is a software for synchronizing and organizing message exchange between (possibly realtime) processes via simple customized Python API.

There are two types of processes;

- A server process encapsulate an instance of o80 back-end as well as an instance of a driver to a (robotic) hardware (real or simulated). The back-end instance computes desired actuator states that they transmit to the hardware via the driver. The back-end also read sensory information (including observed actuator states) from the driver. Typically, the server process is programmed in c++ with consideration for realtime.
- A client process encapsulate an instance of o80 front-end instances, which provides: 1) an interface to send commands to the back-end; commands the back-end will use to determine at each iteration of the server process the desired states to request the driver with, 2) methods for making available sensor information to the user code, and 3) methos for synchronizing the client with the server process.

In the background, back-end and front-end(s) communicate by exchanging serialized object instances (the cereal library) via an interprocess shared memory (boost library).

## Toolbox for customizable Python API

## Example of usage

## Modular Implementation


When using o80, a follower processes will encapsulate instances of BackEnd, while master processes will encapsulate instances of FrontEnd. An instance of FrontEnd provides method for sending commands to the Backend, as well as method for synchronizing the iterations of the follower process with the iterations of the master processes. The instance of the Backend will consume the queues of commands generated by the instances of FrontEnd, while sharing with them observations.

In its typical usage, an instance of o80 BackEnd will be encapsulated in a realtime process that controls a robot (real or simulated). The commands generated by the instances of FrontEnd will correspond to desired states for the robot's joints. The observation shared by the back-ends will encapsulate information about the current observed states of the joints.

o80 FrontEnd exposes convenient methods for sending desired joint states values. These methods allows to specify explicity desired states trajectory, i.e. desired states values for each time real time backend iteration. They allow also to specify implicit trajectories, i.e. trajectories of desired states and indication on how the backend should interpolate between them.

The objective of o80 is to provide a simple python API which allows for (non realtime) python front-ends to interact with (real time c++ coded) backends.



o80 API allows user code to instantiate instances of FrontEnd, which can be used to interact with a separate process. Interacting  


# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

Figures can be included like this:

and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Fenced code blocks are rendered with syntax highlighting:
